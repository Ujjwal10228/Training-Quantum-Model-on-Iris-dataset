# Training-Quantum-Model-on-Iris-dataset

This project involves training a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) model on the well-known classical Iris dataset. The data is encoded into quantum states using the ZZFeature Map and classified using a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC). Additionally, a classical Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is trained on the same dataset to facilitate a comparative analysis between quantum and classical classification approaches.
